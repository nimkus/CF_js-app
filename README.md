# Pokédex JavaScript App

## Overview
This project is a small web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays data from an external API. The app serves as a Pokédex, allowing users to browse a list of Pokémon and view details about each one.

## Features
- **Load data from an external API (Pokémon API)**
- **Display a list of Pokémon**
- **View detailed information for each Pokémon upon user interaction**
- **Styled with CSS for a polished user experience**
- **Uses at least one complex UI pattern, such as a modal for displaying details**
- **Works across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE11)**

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the app
- **CSS3**: Stylesheet for layout and aesthetics
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality and API interactions
- **Fetch API**: To retrieve data from the Pokémon API
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Code formatting and linting for cleaner code
- **Bootstrap**: Optional UI framework for improved styling

## Project Requirements
